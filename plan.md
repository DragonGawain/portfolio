# Design

-   Main page will have a title on the top and a list of my projects
-   Each project will be a horizontal slice
-   On the left side of the slice (~1/3rd?), there will be a picture of the project
-   In the remaining 2/3rds, I'll have a short description
-   The horizontal slice will also be a link that leads to a page that contains a lot of detail about the project
-   FANCY! For my game projects especially, I want to make it so that when you hover over a project, the entire background of the screen is a short looping video demo of the game
